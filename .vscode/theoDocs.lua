function Array:shuffle() end

-- Uses natural order of the elements in the array to sort them. You can optionally provide your own function for comparing two elements.
---@param compFunc? function The comparison function must return a boolean value specifying whether the first argument should be before the second argument in the array. The default behaviour is ascending order. (optional)
